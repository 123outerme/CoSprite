# CoSprite
A new attempt at a 2D engine after outermeSDL really fell short in terms of usability.	
## Building Instructions	
To build, run `make` in the root. If you want to see my test program in action, run `make example`.  	
There are different make options as well, in regards to cleanup:  	
To clean of extra files, run `make clean`. To clean the extra files and the executable, run `make cleanAll`.  	
To make then clean up, run `make thenClean`. To clean the build area then make, run `make fromScratch`.
